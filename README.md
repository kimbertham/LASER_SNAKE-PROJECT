<h1> LASERSNAKE </h1>

<h2> Overview </h2>
<p>1 Week solo Project</p>
<p>A recreation of the classic game snake with a twist, lasers and poison. Creating over a 1 week period using pure vanilla JavaScript. Control of the snake was achieved by creating a grid and altering stlying classes to give the illusion of movement. After sucessfully creating the basic game by day 4, I decided to add in the feature of bombs and posion and altering the games win/loss conditions to fit these new obstacles. To increase difficulty with levels I decided to implement an explanding grid type design in which the available space the snake can access increases with the first three levels. The speed of the snake also increases with levels achieved by creating a direct relationship between the snake length and setTimeout value of the game.  </p>
